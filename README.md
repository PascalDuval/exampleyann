Current use cases : 

Monitor token unlock & sell pressure -  Real-time visualization of token unlock schedules based on vesting parameters /  Identify key sell-off peaks (e.g., team, seed investors, marketing) /  Compare unlock values with the token price to anticipate high-sell zones.  
Simulating and Monitoring Token Prices (Black-Scholes) - Predict token price movements based on volatility (σ) and expected returns (μ) /  Visualize ROI thresholds that trigger increased sell pressure dynamically.
Managing Dynamic Liquidity (Market Depth Provisioning) -  Identify periods where market depth is insufficient to absorb token sales / Strategically allocate liquidity to counter potential overflow / Add liquidity to DEX/CEX during potential unlock peaks / Launch staking or incentive programs to lock tokens and reduce sell pressure.
Optimizing Staking or Lock-up Programs - Deploy staking programs or lock-up mechanisms for specific investor categories (e.g., team, pre-seed) /  Offer incentives (rewards or higher APY) to retain tokens for longer periods.
Tracking Marketing Unlocks and Strategic Allocation -  Plan marketing campaigns: ads, promotions, events, and community growth /  Quantify token budgets to align marketing activities with liquidity and price goals.  
Managing Rewards Distribution and Incentives - Strategically distribute reward tokens over time to incentivize community and project engagement /  Prevent oversaturation of tokens in the market.
Overflow Scenario Analysis - Visualize the overflow of tokens sold that exceeds market depth /  Adjust liquidity provisioning or slow unlock schedules to balance supply and demand.  
Dynamic Vesting Adjustments Based on Market Conditions (Bonding surface)  -  Adjust vesting parameters dynamically based on real-time market conditions /  Increased volatility → Modify price simulations to account for market risks /  ROI triggers exceeded → Dynamically adjust sell pressure percentages (SP %).

Upcoming features & Use cases : 
Evaluating ROI for Investors -  Display the Return on Investment (ROI) based on token price simulations /  Provide visibility on ROI thresholds that trigger increased sell pressure (dynamic SP).
Real-time Investor Communication and Reporting -  Enhance transparency for investors and stakeholders.
